           <br><br>Hello, world! I am Trisha Dela Cruz, and most of my friends call me by my first name, Trisha. 
           I am 20 years old and is currently residing in Bulacan with my parents. <i>My dream is to become an engineer, 
            which is my dream ever since I was a little child</i>. But right now, I am a sophomore 
           BS Computer Science student in University of the Philippines Los Baños. You will see below
           a table of my favorite things regarding my course (I may or may not have add my favorite food too!)

                        This is my favorite CMSC subject so far since I became interested with the different
                        circuits that were discussed here.

                        Aside from the wide knowledge that I gained about different aspects in life,
                        my very considerate and engaging professor is one of the factors why this suibject
                        easily became my favorite.

                        C is the programming I am most familiar with. I am also having a ~fun~ time exploring
                        the syntax of this programming language that's why this became my favorite.

                        I can't say no to any food that is fried. Be it chicken, fries, or even the common
                        Filipino street food such as<i> fishball, kikiam, kwek kwek and tokwa</i>.
